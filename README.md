In terms of the algorithm, I was struggling to make the agent using Minimax thinker. The system is now able to calculate and place its piece, though, however, not the best moves. The winning rate of the agent is about 50%, so I'm not totally satisfied. However, I'm relieved to solve this task since there are not many documents online. The next step to improve this system might be coming up with a new for it to calculate the min and max and also a smart algorithm to calculate which piece to give to the opponent to sabotage their winning. 

Another future logistic is to clean up the code system. I was both brainstorming and coding this game so the code looks a bit messy right now. I'm in the middle of cleaning the runner.py with a modular approach. 

One more thing I would like to try is implement 3D graphics to the game. Though proved running time was longer, I would still want to give it another try.
